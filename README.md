What it can do:
- Create a linked-list and performs functions as a datatype Bag
- Create a array and perfroms functions as a datatype Bag
- Picks 7 pseudo-random letters for a user playing scrabble from both sets of bags

How to build yourself:
- DL [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- CD to scrabble directory
- run ```go build scrabble.go```
- remove other executable ```rm scrabble```
- run ```.\scrabble.go```
- conversly you can run ```go run scrabble.go``` for a temporary executatble
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
